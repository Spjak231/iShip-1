                strategies, you can learn to spend smarter, not harder. This guide will show you practical tips and
                tools to help you take control of your budget and make informed financial decisions.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Your Financial Situation</h2>
            <p>Before you can start spending smarter, it's essential to understand your current financial situation.
                Begin by tracking your income and expenses for a month. This will give you a clear picture of where your
                money is going.</p>

            <div class="tips-container">
                <h3>Steps to Analyze Your Finances:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>List Your Income</strong>: Include all sources of income, such as salary, freelance
                        work, and passive income.</li>
                    <li><strong>Track Your Expenses</strong>: Categorize your expenses into needs (rent, utilities) and
                        wants (dining out, entertainment).</li>
                    <li><strong>Identify Patterns</strong>: Look for trends in your spending. Are there areas where you
                        can cut back?</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h2>Create a Realistic Budget</h2>
            <p>Once you understand your finances, create a budget. This is your plan for allocating income towards
                expenses, savings, and debt repayment.</p>

                        to savings/debt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be Flexible</strong>: Adjust your budget to accommodate unexpected expenses.</li>
